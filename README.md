# React Rails Tutorial

**Install Dependencies**

```shell
bundle install
yarn install
```

**Start the Dev server**

This is technically optional, but it helps by hot reloading changes to JS.

```shell
yarn start
```

**Start the Rails server** (in a separate terminal window)

```shell
rails server
```
